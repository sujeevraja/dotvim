## Helpful hints

- Opening up NERDTree: `ctrl-n`.

- Opening up CtrlP: `ctrl-p`.

- Navigating neocomplete's suggesions: `ctrl-n` from top, `ctrl-p` from bottom.

- Switching between windows in vim: `ctrl-ww`.

- General navigation between windows in vim `ctrl-w(hjkl)`
  (left/down/up/right moves to that window).

- Open scratch pad: `gs`. If something is selected, `gs` will copy it into the
  pad.
